Project Title: Operationalizing Predictive Analytics in Healthcare: Gestational Diabetes Prediction

Project Description:
This MBA project explored the application of machine learning to predict Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), a significant health concern for pregnant women. The aim was to develop a "smart diagnostics" model for early risk identification, enabling timely interventions and personalized care.

Project Objectives:
Develop and evaluate machine learning models for GDM prediction using maternal health records.
Identify key risk factors associated with GDM.
Assess the potential impact of deploying these models in clinical settings.

Dataset Used:
A maternal health dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing features like age, BMI, family history, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

Machine Learning Models Used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP)

Key Findings:
The Neural Network model achieved the highest accuracy, with 97.52% on the test dataset.
Key risk factors identified include age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and OGTT.
The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to improve GDM prediction and patient outcomes.

Additional Notes:
Data preprocessing included KNN imputation and outlier removal.
This project highlights the potential and challenges of integrating predictive analytics into healthcare.
Future work could focus on validation with real-time data and EHR integration.
